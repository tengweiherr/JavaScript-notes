# **Hoisting**

- `var`Â variables are hoisting, meaning they will get moved to the top of their scope and initialized as `undefined`, so we can use them before the declarations.
- `let`Â andÂ `const`Â are non-hoisting, JavaScript forbids any use of the variables declared with let and const before its declaration. We will see `ReferenceError` if we try to do so. This limitation is also called [**Temporal dead zone (TDZ)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz).**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where the interpreter appears to move theÂ *declaration*Â of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, before the code execution. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Variables declared withÂ `let`,Â `const`, orÂ `class`Â is said to be in a [**Temporal dead zone (TDZ)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz) from the start of the block until code execution reaches the place where the variable is declared and initialized.

# Assignment

- We can declareÂ `var`Â variables again and change their values.
- We can changeÂ `let`Â variables' values but can't declare them again.
- `const`Â can't be declared again or have its value changed.
